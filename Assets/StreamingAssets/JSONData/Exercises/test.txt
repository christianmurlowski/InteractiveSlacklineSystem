Goals
Congratulations and welcome to tier 2! Here you will have your first contact with the slackline
You will learn how your body behaves on how to handle these unpredictable movement

First Contact || 2_Tier
----------
Goals
Congratulations and welcome to tier 2! Here you will have your first contact with the slackline
You will learn how your body behaves on how to handle these unpredictable movement
Get a feeling for the slackline, become familiar with it, feel the imbalance of your body, stay calm, and counteract right
At the end you should be able to get up and hold yourself on the line for a short time
If you are unsure about any execution, please ask me and/or try it with external help. Safety first!

----------
Tips
Start at the sweet-spot, which is in about 1/4 of the line. This is generally a good area with pleasant vibration characteristic
Your foot should be always in alignment with the slackline
Don't forget to have your arms over the shoulder and bent in about 135 degree position
If you have troubles with the arms, turn your palms to the top, which will automatically raise your arms
Your head is up and focus set to a specific point in front of you
Learn the interplay with your arms, upper and lower body for counterbalancing

Static Exercises || 3_Tier
----------
Goals
Now it gets more difficult for you. All former learned techniques should now be applied
You will fulfill static exercises and first approaches for walking on the line
With this you learn the basics for staying and the preparation for making some steps
At the end you should have learned the basics for slacklining, be able to stay a couple of seconds on the line and feel more confident on it

----------
Tips
At first you might not be able to stay on the slackline because of the unexpected body movements. But this is okay! Just focus and try it again
Keep in mind: focus point, sweet-spot, foot in line, knees slightly bent, arms up, relaxed muscles but straight upper body
Perform slowly and controlled, no need to hurry
Your non-standing foot serves also as balance support
It might help, when going up, to keep your non standing leg vertical in line with your other standing leg and then raise it to the side
The pressure is mostly around the ball of your foot

Dynamic Exercises || 4_Tier
----------
Goals
Congratulations! You achieved to stay on the slackline!
For this last tier, you will learn how to make your first steps as continuation to the last two exercise from the former tier
You should then be able to walk step by step without getting out of balance

----------
Tips
When making a step you can guide your non standing foot to the side of the line and shift it forward. With this you won't miss the line
Also let your knees together when walking forward, so your legs can support each other
Make small steps, your bodie's center of gravity doesn't have to be shiftet that much forward, which results in less balancing problems
Use your whole body to counterbalance
Remember to stay calm and execute the exercise slowly and controlled, especially for this tier
